<!-- Create a script (operators.php) to demonstrate the use of different operators in PHP:

a) Write a program that takes two numbers and displays their:


Sum

Difference

Product

Division

Modulus -->


<?php

$num2 = 5;


$sum = $num1 + $num2;
echo "Sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $sum<br>";


$difference = $num1 - $num2;
echo "Difference of $num1 and $num2 is: $difference<br>";


$product = $num1 * $num2;
echo "Product of $num1 and $num2 is: $product<br>";


if ($num2 != 0) {
    $division = $num1 / $num2;
    echo "Division of $num1 by $num2 is: $division<br>";
} else {
    echo "Division by zero is not allowed.<br>";
